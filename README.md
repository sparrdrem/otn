# OTN (Old To New) Remote Printing Standard
## "Letting Your Old Devices Print Again!"

Note, I was tired while making this, and kind of just winged it and threw some information on a file. It'll be revised some time later.
Also note, this is TECHNICALLY not a standard, it just sounds cool.

OTN Remote Printing Standard lets your older devices like a PowerMac G3 or a Windows 2000 computer communicate with newer printers. Or, to be more specific, make a newer computer communicate to a printer for it.

## How It Works
If you don't want to know and just want to set it up, skip this snd go to "Installation and Usage". Otherwise, read! It's pretty simple!

In this, the modern computer will be refered to as the "client" and the old computer the "server". This will be explained later.

The client hosts a script that controls all of the client-side magic. The server connects to the modern PC and inputs information (IP and file name).

### The Client-side Magic
The client consists of 3 components - the Frontend, WGET, and, the beating heart of OTN, PDFToPrinter. WGET downloads the PDF from the server and PDFToPrinter prints it, while the front end wraps it all up into a user-friendly script.

### The Not-As-Cool Server-side Magic
The server really only consists of an FTP server, which hosts the PDF files on the computer.

## Why I Made This Project
Well it's a few years before college, I might as well start making some preparations. I decided I'd use my PowerMac G3 as my main computer and bring my desktop for gaming and to keep some servers I run operational. Sure, I could just use my desktop, but I just really want to use my PowerMac. So I will. One thing I know I'll have to do is print documents. However, I realized that its gonna be hard and expensive to find a printer that has drivers for Mac OS 9.2.2, so I needed a different solution, and that's when I made OTN.

## Installation and Usage
### PowerMac Instructions
1.) On the server computer (the PowerMac) download the files on the latest release. You may need to use a CD to get it on it.
2.)
